## The Golden Rule: 

ü¶∏ ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è `Stop starting and start finishing.` üèÅ

If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

## Making a plan

1) **Make a drawing of your app. Simple "wireframes"** 
1) **Look at the drawing and name the HTML elements you'll need to realize your vision**
1) **Look at the drawing and imagine using the app. What _state_ do you need to track?** 


###To do list###

- Come up with domains for my data
-Create an array of 3 objects for the domain
-TDD the render fucntion
-Import array and render fucntion and grab a container element from the DOM
-Loop through the array, render and apend a styled domain element.
1) **For each HTML element ask: Why do I need this? (i.e., "we need div to display the results in")** 


###HTML Elements###
*Heading
*Paragraph
*Image
*`div`
*`ul`
1) **Once we know _why_ we need each element, think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How" (i.e., `resultsEl.textContent = newResults`)**
